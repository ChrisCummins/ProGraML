# ﻿Neural Code Comprehension: A Learnable Representation of Code Semantics.
#
# Adapting the ncc codebase to run in my repository. The ncc implementation was
# developed by the authors of this paper:
#
#       ﻿Ben-Nun, T., Jakobovits, A. S., & Hoefler, T. (2018). Neural Code
#       Comprehension: A Learnable Representation of Code Semantics. In NeurIPS.
#       https://doi.org/arXiv:1806.07336v3
#
# The two main changes required to make the code fit my use case is:
#   1. Support for execution within bazel sandbox.
#   2. Tests!
