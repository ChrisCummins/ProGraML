class BaseGraphLoader(object):
    """Base class for loading graphs from some dataset.

    This class behaves like an iterator over tuples of program graph
    data, with the addition of a Stop() method to signal that no further
    tuples will be consumed. The type of iterable values is described by
    the class itself, accessible using loader.IterableType() method.
    This enables you to "swap" in and out different loaders with different
    behaviour.

    Example usage:

        graph_loader = MyGraphLoader(...)
        assert graph_loader.IterableType() == (
          ProgramGraph,
          ProgramGraphFeatures,
        )
        for graph, features in graph_loader:
          # ... do something with graphs
          if done:
            self.graph_loader.Stop()

    """
