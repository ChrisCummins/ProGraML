class AsyncBatchBuilder(object):
    """A class for running a batch builder in a background thread.

    An AsyncBatchBuilder runs a batch builder in the background until completion,
    storing the generated batches in an in-memory list. Use this class to
    construct a bunch of batches in the background while you are busy doing
    something else. For example:

        bb = AsyncBatchBuilder(MyBatchBuilder(my_graph_loader))
        # ... do some busywork
        for batch in bb.batches:
          # go nuts!

    Because the batches are loaded into a plain python list, this also provides
    a convenient means for reusing a set of batches. For example, to always
    use the same set of batches during validation runs of a model:

      val_batches = AsyncBatchBuilder(batch_builder)
      for epoch in range(10):
        # ... train model, val_batches are loading in the background
        model.RunBatch(val_batches.batches)
